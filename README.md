# Python Task-Based Project

This repository contains a series of Python learning tasks, each organized into its own folder.

## Tasks
- Task 1: Project setup with Git and virtual environment.
- Task 2: Basic input/output using simple data types and data types.
- Task 3: Menu-driven program with control structures if-else statements and loops.
- Task 4: Store and display transactions using list, tuple, sets and dictionary.
- Task 5: Refractor the program to define separate functions:
          1. add_income()
          2. add_expense()
          3. view_transactions()
          4. delete_transaction()
          5. view_balance()
- Task 6: File Handling- 
          1. Implement functionality to load existing transactions from a CSV file when the program starts.
          2. Write new transactions to the CSV file whenever they are added, and handle cases where the file does not exist.
- Task 7: "Enhance program with error handling to manage:
          1. Invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values for amounts).
          2. File-related errors (e.g., file not found).
          3. Test application to ensure it gracefully handles edge cases (e.g., when there are no transactions to view or delete).
